## Getting Started

This is a website to match users with their soul mate by a survey and the magic of math to count the compability :) here is the [Deploy Page](https://findfriendbyyuwen.herokuapp.com/). Take a look!


### Prerequisites

To run the website locally please first follow the steps below

1. Clone the whole repository and get into the directory in your terminal.
2. In your terminal and in the root directory of the repository type in  `npm install`  to set up all the required modules.
3. Run the server.js by entering `node server.js` in the root directory. 
4. Open your browser and enter `http://localhost:3000/` as the address. Ta-da! Start looking for your soulmate!

## How to use it

- Click the `Tell me something about you` button to start the journey;
- Follow the instructions on the page to fill in your personal info, and upload an photo of you (**make sure it is smaller than 50kb!**);
- Click the submit button and you'll be led to the survey;
- Answer all the questions heartfully! There are only 10 questions and you choose scale from 1 to 5 (that is, from disagree to agree)! Don't think too much, answering each one within 20 seconds!
- After you finish the last one, your soul mate will pop up on screen! (He/she is the one whose answers have the least difference compared with yours)
